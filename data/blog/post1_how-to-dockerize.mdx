# Introduction

Dockerizing applications is a powerful way to ensure consistency and portability across different environments. 
In this guide, we will walk through the process of containerizing a Flask web application on Fedora 40. By the end, 
you’ll have a Flask app running inside a Docker container, making it easier to deploy and manage in various 
environments. Whether you're building a small project or deploying at scale, Docker provides the tools to streamline 
your development workflow. To do that, of course you need to have Docker installed on your machine. 
Let’s get started!

# Instruction

## Grant non-root docker command
Before you proceed to build Docker image, make sure you have enabled non-root Docker command. To do that:

1. Create the docker group.
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

2. Add your user to the docker group.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

3. Log out and log back to your terminal by close and open it back.

4. Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo. Just run any docker command.
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

5. If you still can't run the docker without non-root. You need to modifies the permissions of 
the Docker socket file (/var/run/docker.sock). So, run this command.
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

6. Now, you should be able to run any docker command without sudo.

## Writing a .dockerfile and .dockerignore

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions used to build a Docker image. 
Each command in a Dockerfile describes how to set up the environment, install software, 
and configure settings in the container. This is my Dockerfile. You can copy it if you want and modify 
it based on your project.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Pipfile and Pipfile.lock into the container
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock /app/

# Install dependencies from Pipfile
RUN pip install pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Expose port 5000 for the Flask application
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variables
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Run the application
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

.dockerignore functions similarly to a .gitignore file in Git, which is preventing unnecessary files 
(like build artifacts, temporary files, or local environment configurations) from being copied 
into the Docker image, which can help reduce the image size and improve build performance. So, don't forget to 
create and write what files you do not want include when build the image.

## Building Docker image

A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to 
run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration 
files. It serves as a template for creating Docker containers. To build a docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t <specify-your-image-name>
```

Wait for the process to finish. It can take several minutes, depending on the total size of your projects.
After the process is done building the image, you can check your images by running:

```bash
docker images
```

And the output will look like this. I will explain why I name my docker image name like this in the next post. 

![docker-image](/static/images/Post-1/docker-image.png)

## Start the Docker container

To see whether the image we just built can be used or not, we can start a container from a Docker image.
A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It includes everything in the image along with a 
writable layer, allowing you to execute applications and perform operations. To start a container, run:

```bash
docker run <your-image-name>
```

This command will start the Docker container. You should see the URL of your localhost like this:

![docker-run](/static/images/Post-1/docker-run.png)

Now, open the link to see your Flask web application.

## Throubleshoot

If you can't open the link or the container doesn't start, there might be something wrong with 
your Dockerfile or your code. Sometimes, the commands you write in the Dockerfile are not the same 
as those you used during development. Check the port you used during development and expose it on Dockerfile.

# Conclusion
Dockerizing your Flask web application on Fedora 40 ensures consistency across different environments, 
making it easier to deploy and manage. By following the steps in this guide, you’ve learned how to grant 
non-root Docker access, write a Dockerfile and .dockerignore, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container. 
Troubleshooting common issues, such as misconfigured ports or Dockerfile commands, is also essential to ensure 
smooth operation. With your app now running inside a Docker container, you’ve streamlined your workflow and made 
your application more portable and scalable for future deployments.
